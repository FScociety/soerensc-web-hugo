For art class, we were asked to create a work on the theme 'Together we are strong'. The medium wasn't specified. Because of my experience with Blender, I thought about creating a 3D animated short film.

## Story

The short film is about two robots. At the beginning you only see a blue one (symbol for a man). He wakes up and discovers a silver sphere. On the way to it he has a flashback, how he meets a purple (symbol for a woman) robot. As the movie progresses, it turns out that this purple robot was once hit by a huge ball and the two were separated. The blue one continues on its journey and shoots away many balls until it comes across a big one. This one he cannot push away. He is about to be crushed when the purple robot appears with many white ones and together they save the blue one.

## Roboter Creation

At the beginning it was clear, the project should be about robots, but I was not sure how they should look. To find out, I made a few sketches and also modeled a few test models in Blender.

## Story Creation

## Animation

At "1:38", a very large collection of robots is approaching the sphere. I simulated the whole thing with Blender and the "Molecular-Addon". It was important to me to show the large masses of robots.

This scene is not directly in the movie, however the explosion is: "1:53". For the implementation of the explosion I used the real-time simulation program EmberGen and imported it as an OpenVDB into Blender.
