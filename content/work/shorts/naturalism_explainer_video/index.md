summary: "A school project about a german literature epoche explained in minecraft."

{{< text align=center >}}
For the German class in the 11th grade we were supposed to make an explanatory video about literature era.
Together with a buddy we made a video about naturalism.
We thought it would be a fun idea to film the whole thing in Minecraft.
This allowed us to choose the location freely, because we just had to build them to use them.

## Story

The explanatory video shows me "Sören", who starts his paper on naturalism much too late and rushes to a library. There he meets a very helpful librarian, who guides him through the library and explains everything important about naturalism. He is thus able to give his lecture on time.

At "3:19" I wanted to show the new books. For this I decided to make a cut on posters that are currently on display. In the game Minecraft it is possible to add your own 3D models with modifications. But to animate them physically correct is unfortunately not possible. That's why I roughly recreated the camera and the scene in Blender. I then animated the posters with Blender's internal cloth solver and superimposed everything on the Minecraft scene.

At "0:20" I wanted to replace the screen to better show the call between Sören and his friend. To do this, I superimposed a screen shot over the screen. To better place the image in the scene, I added blur to the edge.
(If I were to do the scene again, I would probably match the colors of the scene more to original footage).

At "7:09" I wanted to use the conclusion of Sören's lecture as the conclusion of the video. For this I have created a text conclusion and tracked it on the board, like the light from the beamer.
